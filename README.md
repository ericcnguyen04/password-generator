# Password Generator

After approximately 4 months of the job hunt, I figured it is time to build my credibility by making more projects!

I found people who I look up to, including a Georgia Tech Alumni. I noticed his position in the field too, I envy him. I looked through his projects, and the one I came across was a password generator.

This project is an inspiration of who I look up to!

## Approach

It will be a small project, but I wanted to make it a simple react format with pleasant styling. Once I get the base format down, I will now develop the logic and code for it!

## Technologies used

I used react and javascript to develop this project. To deploy, I will use github pages to add to my portfolio!

## Goals
- make it generate a password
- let users determine the length of the password
- pleasantly nice view
